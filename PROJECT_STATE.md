# Curvature optics migration — project state

Updated at compatpatch **103** (2026-10-27), after the first explicit event/visibility contract. Refresh after approximately every 5–10 patches **and** after major architectural decisions. This file is a compact handoff, not a substitute for focused patch documentation.

## Objective

An independently computed physical comparison of Globe and Flat observations: world geometry + atmospheric refractive index `n(h)` + ray equations + first-hit visibility produce the image, **without hardcoding a horizon law or using the legacy horizon occlusion mask**.

## Current baseline

- Latest migration milestone: **103**, standalone stratified-atmosphere point-to-point shooting with first-ground-contact visibility statuses (`docs/MIGRATION_TARGET_PROJECTION_103.md`). `CurvatureTargetProjection.solve` returns a launch angle and residual when one forward-x connecting path is found; numerical/search failures are explicitly `solver_failed`. No Canvas or UI selection changes.
- Recent sequence: 95 runtime extraction, 96 render-frame/renderer contract, 97 main Canvas preview, 97.1 two active object groups, 97.2 horizon tessellation and stroke styles, 98 independent vacuum/geometry regression, 99 core audit, 100 RK4 tests and ground-impact accuracy, 101 bounded ground events and 2D vacuum target visibility, 102 engineered atmospheric profiles and analytic tangent/trajectory validation, 103 atmospheric target-angle shooting and ground-only visibility.
- Legacy DrawModel remains selectable/default; Independent painter preview handles Globe and Flat separately, both supported object groups, with some overlays/annotations absent. `Both` uses Legacy fallback.
- Independent geometric composition uses an ordered horizon disk/mask for presentation; this is **not** physical ray-derived occlusion.
- Numerical `CurvatureRayTracer` already exists (2D fixed-step RK4, vacuum/standard/custom `n(h)`), now tested for analytic vacuum impacts, numerical refinement, invariants and reciprocity; a signed one-step `advanceState()` API and bounded first-ground-event search are available for diagnostics. `vacuumTargetVisibility()` gives restricted 2D ground-only `visible`/`blocked`/`indeterminate` semantics. It is **not** the physical primary-Canvas renderer. Optical P4 diagnostics/overlays and effective-radius `legacy-k` are separate mechanisms.
- Patch 99 retained the 270-test baseline. Patch 100 added 12 numerical tests; patch 101 added 11 ground-event/visibility tests; patch 102 added 8 independent analytic profile tests (301 total); patch 103 adds 14 independent shooting/visibility tests (315 expected).

## Source of truth / workflow

Only use the user-supplied `chatgpt-pack-*` archive (choose the explicitly named pack, otherwise newest timestamp). Unpack it into a temporary Git workspace and apply outstanding compatpatches **in sequence** before making further changes. Never mix packs or reconstruct missing files by guessing. Make one focused commit and distribute as Git `format-patch` (prefer ZIP containing `.patch`); use the repository Git author and English passive-voice commit subject. Test on a clean reapplication. Include in chat: commit subject, validation, browser-check instructions if needed, and next patch preview.

## Invariants / guardrails

- Do not conflate `Canvas engine`, `Optical comparison` and optical physics/profile selection.
- Vacuum means straight optical rays, regardless of surface geometry.
- Solver `no solution` is not proof of physical occlusion; distinguish numerical failure from blocked geometry.
- `legacy-k` effective radius is a proxy, **not** a numerical `n(h)` ray solution.
- Keep camera/units explicit: metres, radians, tangent-plane reference.
- Geometry tests and physical ray-intersection oracles take priority over pixel equality.

## Open limitations

2D/3D coupling, global completeness of ground-event isolation for rapidly varying profiles, lack of adaptive error control, global/multipath completeness of atmospheric target shooting (103 covers one forward-x branch), physical mesh intersections, and ray-driven main Canvas visibility. Details and proposed interface contracts: `docs/MIGRATION_OPTICS_AUDIT_99.md`.

## Architectural decision after patch 101

The intended optics scope is standard exponential atmospheric refractivity and an analytically engineered positive-gradient profile for Flat horizon occlusion, not mirages or arbitrary multipath rendering. The inverse-spherical profile from Maslovsky (2026), Eq. (73), reproduces the exact spherical *grazing visibility boundary* at equal endpoint heights for configurable R. The simpler exponential-occlusion profile has an exact non-paraxial ray family and is useful as an independent RK4 oracle. Neither is claimed to reproduce all Globe image geometry. The user proposes to accelerate the rendering of all towers by caching a shared optical field covering their common bounding rectangular prism, **not** running an integrator per tower edge.

## Next steps

100–103: complete (fixed-step numerical core, bounded ground events, atmospheric analytical validation, and single-branch target-angle/visibility API). 104: shared cached ray bundle / optical mapping inside the tower prism. 105: measured interpolation errors vs reference tracing and 2/10/85 tower performance, adjusting pixel tolerance. 106: physical tower silhouettes with first-hit occlusion. 107: wire into Independent Canvas. 108: Globe vs Flat validation for several observer heights and R. Update this file after about 5–10 patches or significant architectural decisions. Recommended effort: High for numerical physics, and potentially Extra High for 103 shooting solver.
